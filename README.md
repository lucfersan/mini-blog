## 📚 About The Project

I've been hearing good things about Prisma these couple of days, that's what motivated me to use it.

My first impressions of Prisma were amazing. I've never experienced an ORM like this before. Its way to work with the schema and run the migrations is simply fantastic.

In this project I also decided to maintain Nest, just to get to know it a little bit more and to practice a few. I'm quite liking Nest, and combining it with Prisma was what made this project really fun!

I hope to work on new projects with those technologies.
